## Overview

These are the leaderboards for [Gem TD+].  If you have a great game, make
sure to share it with others!  Encourage players you encounter to do the
same.  And, yes, you can play offline; just provide the needed information.

Do realize that this is not an exhaustive list of all the best games.  Only
those reported can be included, and as the competition grows steeper many do
not make the cut.  However, this repository does accurately reflect the
state of the leaderboards at a given moment in time.

## How to Submit

1. Join the offical Gem TD+ [Discord].
2. Ensure you are playing on an eligible version of the map.  Check the
   leaderboard in question for details of which version you should be
   playing.  Typically, this will be the latest release.
3. Provide a [screenshot](#screenshot) **and** [replay](#replay) in the
   `#submitted-games` channel.  A game will not be verified without a
   replay. *Tip: Just drag them into the channel!*
4. See if further information is needed for verification.
5. Join the leaderboards, then try to make sure your name stays there!

*Note: Testing versions are **never** eligible for the leaderboards.*

### Screenshot

Before leaving the game take a screenshot.  If you forget, you can take one
from within the replay.  You can use whatever method you prefer, but using
the `Print Screen` key to have Warcraft III create the screenshot is the
most common.

Bue sure that both your maze and the open board are in your screenshot.
Your player name, the time of finish, and the game identifier must be
visible.  The identifier is used to make sure a screenshot pairs with a
replay.

### Replay

Upon leaving a game the option to save a replay should be available.  If it
is not, or you forget, check for `LastReplay.w3g`.  Do note that this will
be overwritten upon playing your next game.  Also consider the game option
to automatically save replays for every game you play.

## How to View

A replay is tied to a specific version or versions of Warcraft III.  This
can either be a single patch or a range of patches.  In order to view that
replay, one must have access to an installation of Warcraft III that is
patched accordingly.

### Zoom

Starting in Gem TD+ 1.5.3, the camera zoom used when viewing a replay
defaults to `2500`.  In older versions this was not the case, and the camera
would change due to the use of the `-zoom` command.  If the camera in one of
these older versions seems to be stuck, or you would prefer to return the
camera to the default Warcraft III zoom of `1650`, press `Insert` or
`Delete` briefly.

### Map Location

The location of the map used when playing the game is recorded into the
replay.  For most players, this will a file be the following folder:
`Maps/Downloads`.  However, it could differ.  In such situations it may be
necessary to place a copy of the map into another location to view a replay.

## Pre 1.5

The leaderboard system, as well as DPS tracking, did not begin until the
release of Gem TD+ 1.5.  As such, there are many games without screenshots
and replays.  These are the best know times that have been verified.

<details>
<summary><strong>Pre 1.4</strong>: 39:52 - herr_beppo</summary>

- Patch: Unknown.  Most likely 1.26.
- Version: Bryvx's Gem TD 3.1
- Notes: The video says Gem TD 4.0.  However, there is no actual gameplay
  difference between that unofficial version and the last official version
  by Bryvx.  Until Gem TD+ 1.4.0, the gameplay and balance between the
  original Gem TD and that of Gem TD Plus was essentially the same.

## 1.5 Leaderboards

The current 1.5 leaderboards will close upon the release of 1.6.  The
players with the top three times and DPS (aside from [NVS]) will be
recognized (details pending).  Each section will show at most ten players,
and a player can only be in each section once.

**Note: As of 2019-01-20, only Gem TD+ 1.5.3 or higher is eligible for the
1.5 Leaderboards.**
