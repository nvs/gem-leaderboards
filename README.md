## Overview

These are the leaderboards for [Gem TD+].  If you have a great game, make
sure to share it with others!  Encourage players you encounter to do the
same.  And, yes, you can play offline; just provide the needed information.

Do realize that this is not an exhaustive list of all the best games.  Only
those reported can be included, and as the competition grows steeper many do
not make the cut.  However, this repository does accurately reflect the
state of the leaderboards at a given moment in time.

## How to Submit

1. Join the official [Gem TD+ Discord].  Your Discord account is used to
   identify your submitted games.  Games cannot be submitted on someone
   else's behalf.
2. Ensure you are playing the [latest version] of the map.  Games played on
   older versions are not accepted.  *Note: Testing versions are **never**
   eligible for the leaderboards.*
3. Provide a [screenshot](#screenshot) **and** [replay](#replay) in the
   `#submitted-games` channel.  A game will not be verified without a
   replay. *Tip: Just drag them into the channel!*
4. See if further information is needed for verification.
5. Join the leaderboards, then try to make sure your name stays there!

### Screenshot

Before leaving the game take a screenshot.  If you forget, you can take one
from within the replay.  You can use whatever method you prefer, but using
the `Print Screen` key to have Warcraft III create the screenshot is the
most common.

Be sure that both your maze and the open board are in your screenshot.  Your
player name, the time of finish, and the game identifier must be visible.
The identifier is used to pair a screenshot with a replay.

### Replay

Upon leaving a game the option to save a replay should be available.  If it
is not, or you forget, check for `LastReplay.w3g`.  Do note that this will
be overwritten upon playing your next game.  Also, consider the game option
to automatically save replays for every game you play.

## How to View

A replay is tied to a specific version or versions of Warcraft III.  This
can either be a single patch or a range of patches.  In order to view that
replay, one must have access to an installation of Warcraft III that is
patched accordingly.

### Zoom

Starting in Gem TD+ 1.5.3, the camera zoom used when viewing a replay
defaults to `2500`.  In older versions, this was not the case, and the
camera would change due to the use of the `-zoom` command.  If the camera in
one of these older versions seems to be stuck, or you would prefer to return
the camera to the default Warcraft III zoom of `1650`, press `Insert` or
`Delete` briefly.

### Map Location

The location of the map used when playing the game is recorded into the
replay.  For most players, this will be a file in the following folder:
`Maps/Download`.  However, it could differ.  In such situations, it may be
necessary to place a copy of the map into another location to view a replay.

## Pre 1.5

The leaderboard system did not begin until the release of Gem TD+ 1.5.  As
such, there are many games without screenshots and replays.  These are the
best known **Damage Test** kills that have been verified.

<details>
<summary><strong>Pre 1.4</strong>: 39:52 - herr_beppo</summary>

- Patch: Unknown.  Most likely 1.26.
- Version: Bryvx's Gem TD 3.1
- Notes: The video says Gem TD 4.0.  However, there is no actual gameplay
  difference between that unofficial version and the last official version
  by Bryvx.  Until Gem TD+ 1.4.0, the gameplay and balance between the
  original Gem TD and that of Gem TD Plus were essentially the same.

## 1.5 Leaderboards

The current 1.5 leaderboards will close upon the release of 1.6.  The
players with the top three **Damage Test** kills (aside from [NVS]) will be
recognized (details pending).  Each section will show at most ten players,
and a player can only be in each section once.
